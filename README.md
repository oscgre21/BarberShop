# BackEnd BarberShop
This is a base project for all my proyect try to make a clean Architecture templeate.


The app was built using:
* ASP.NET Core 5.0
* ASP.NET Core Identity
* AutoMapper     

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository and Open it with VS.
 

  * **Database Setting**
    * The app is using localhost by default so you don't need to change this but if you wish you can change the ConnectionString "**DefaultConnection**" to match your MySQL/SQL Server Instance.
 
2. Run update-database command
``` bash
  Update-Database
```
